### Description
- Trying to ensure that the site works on different screen widths (13.5" laptop, 21" monitor, 6" phone) _while_ writing the first version of the website really slowed me down. For future, should focus on making it work for one screen width initially. Optimizations for different screen-widths can be done later.
- Adding images in CSS as div backgrounds vs as html tags: I found the CSS route to be easier because of easy to use properties like background-size: cover, background-position: center. 
- Need to have a better understanding of differences between and best-case uses for %, px, vw, vh units.


### Styling Focus (Option 2)
- Radio buttons hidden using 'checkbox hack'.
- Hovering over answer choices results in 'pop-up' effect.
- Output is a modal and is animated (fades into screen-middle from screen-top).
- Light sweep effect when hovering over submit button.
- Page works perfectly in mobile; answer choices arrange as columns instead of rows.
